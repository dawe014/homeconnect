## üìñ About the Project

HomeConnect is a modern, feature-rich real estate listing platform built from the ground up using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and TypeScript. The application provides a seamless experience for users to browse properties, for agents to manage their listings, and for administrators to oversee the entire platform.

This project was developed as a comprehensive portfolio piece to showcase skills in full-stack development, modern UI/UX design, and professional application architecture. It covers everything from secure, role-based authentication to dynamic data filtering and interactive mapping.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- pnpm (or npm/yarn)
- A MongoDB Atlas account or a local MongoDB instance

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/dawe014/homeconnect.git
    cd homeconnect
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies in the root directory:**

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Setup Backend Environment Variables:**

    - Navigate to the `/server` directory: `cd server`
    - Create a `.env` file and add the following variables:
      ```env
      PORT=8000
      DATABASE_URL="your_mongodb_connection_string"
      JWT_SECRET="your_super_secret_jwt_key"
      CLIENT_URL="http://localhost:5173"
      ```

4.  **Setup Frontend Environment Variables:**

    - Navigate to the `/client` directory: `cd ../client`
    - Create a `.env` file and add the following:
      ```env
      VITE_API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8000/api"
      VITE_API_SERVER_URL="http://localhost:8000"
      ```

5.  **Run the application:**

    - You will need two separate terminal windows.
    - **Terminal 1 (Backend):**
      ```sh
      cd server
      npm run dev
      ```
    - **Terminal 2 (Frontend):**
      ```sh
